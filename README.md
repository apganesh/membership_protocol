Implementation of Membership Protocol using gossiping.  Provided a simulator and front end web app to follow the node status along with the metrics.  Currently using a random metrics generator.  We can plug in the actual memory and CPU usage metrics and also extend it to network status too.

An interactive demo with nodes being added and removed from the cluster with metrics can be seen in this [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5DP82LM5Bo7UU1hV1hkVHlCeXc)
